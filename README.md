# basic-example-ml-api

*1 First runt the model.py to train and save a model artifact for the first time.
*2 Run server to host your in-code model artifact as a RESTful API
*3 Keep practicing

Obs.: In normal industrial settings the model and data are not held together within the same project, 
and there are auxiliary systems to keep track of the experiment setups and results. But, this is advanced MLOps, and this
project is just a simple introduction to Machine Learning Engineering.
